This document is meant for iOS developers looking to apply their
existing iOS knowledge to build mobile apps with Flutter. If you understand
the fundamentals of the iOS framework then you can use this document as a
jump start to Flutter development.

Your iOS knowledge and skill set are highly valuable when building with
Flutter, because Flutter relies on the mobile operating system for numerous
capabilities and configurations. Flutter is a new way to build UIs for mobile,
but it has a plugin system to communicate with iOS (and Android) for non-UI
tasks. If you're an expert in iOS development, you don't have to relearn everything
to use Flutter.

This document can be used as a cookbook by jumping around and finding questions
that are most relevant to your needs.
