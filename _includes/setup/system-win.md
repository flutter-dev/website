## System requirements

To install and run Flutter, your development environment must meet these minimum requirements:

* **Operating Systems**: Windows 7 SP1 or later (64-bit)
* **Disk Space**: 400 MB (does not include disk space for Android Studio).
* **Tools**: Flutter depends on these tools being available in your environment.
  * [PowerShell 5.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/setup/installing-windows-powershell#upgrading-existing-windows-powershell) or newer
  * [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win) (with the "Use Git from the Windows Command Prompt" option)

     If Git for Windows is already installed, make sure you can run `git` commands from the
     Command Prompt or PowerShell.
